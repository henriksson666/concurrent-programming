# Train Class

The `Train` class is a JavaFX application that simulates the movement of two trains along predefined rail paths on a graphical user interface (GUI). This application allows users to control the behavior of the trains, change their paths, adjust their velocities, and more.

## Overview

The `Train` class is a JavaFX application developed to provide a visual representation of trains moving along predefined rail paths. It utilizes JavaFX for the GUI components and animations. The application creates a graphical environment with two trains represented as rectangles, and these trains move along specified paths using path transitions.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you should have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that you have Java JDK 8 or later installed on your system.

## Usage

To use the `Train` application, follow these steps:

1. **Compile**: Compile the Java source code, including the `Train.java` file, using the Java compiler.

   ```bash
   javac Train.java
   ```

2. **Run**: Execute the compiled Java application.

   ```bash
   java Train
   ```

3. **GUI**: The application's GUI will appear, allowing you to interact with the simulation.

## Application Features

- **Train Animation**: The application features two trains represented as rectangles that move along predefined paths.
- **Configuration Changes**: Users can change the configuration of the rail paths to create different scenarios.
- **Velocity Control**: You can adjust the velocity of each train independently using sliders.
- **Play/Pause**: The "Play" button allows you to start or pause the animation.
- **Reset/Restart**: Buttons are available to reset the simulation or restart from the beginning.
- **Change Direction**: The "Change Direction" button lets you change the direction of the trains on the rail paths.

## Class Structure

The `Train` class extends the `Application` class from JavaFX and provides the main entry point for the application. Key components and methods include:

- **GUI Setup**: Configuration and setup of the graphical user interface, including trains, rail paths, buttons, sliders, and labels.
- **Path Transitions**: Creation and management of path transitions for the trains' movement.
- **Event Handling**: Handling of user interactions such as button clicks, slider adjustments, and path configuration changes.
- **Path Calculation**: Methods to calculate angles and paths based on user-defined parameters.

## Important Methods

### `createTrain(double x, double y, Color color)`

This method creates and returns a rectangular train shape with the specified position (x, y) and color.

### `createPathTransition(Shape trainImage, Path rail)`

Creates a path transition for a given train image to move along a specified rail path.

### `createRails(int configuration, Rectangle train1, Rectangle train2, boolean startTransitions)`

Generates rail paths based on the chosen configuration and restarts path transitions if required.

### `calculateAngle(Path path, double t)`

Calculates the angle of rotation for a train based on its position along a path at time t.

### `createPath(double[] angles, double x, double y, double length, int numIntermediatePoints, boolean reverse)`

Creates a custom path based on provided angles and other parameters.

### `reversePath(Path originalPath)`

Reverses the elements of a given path to change the direction of movement.

## Event Handling

The application handles various user interactions through event handlers:

- **Reset Button**: Resets the animation and repositions the trains.
- **Restart Button**: Restarts the animation from the beginning.
- **Change Direction Button**: Changes the configuration of the rail paths.
- **Play/Pause Button**: Toggles between playing and pausing the animation.
- **Slider Controls**: Adjust the velocity of each train.
